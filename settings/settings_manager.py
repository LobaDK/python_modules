class SettingsManagerWithDataclass(SettingsManagerBase[T]):
    """
    SettingsManager variant which uses a dataclass to store settings. Supports saving as JSON, INI, YAML and TOML.

    This class provides functionality for managing settings data, including loading, saving, and sanitizing settings.
    Supports type parameterization to help IDEs and type checkers infer which settings object is being used and its structure.
    Refer to the Examples section for more information on how to use this class.

    args:
        path (Optional[str]): The path to the settings file. Defaults to None, but is required if read_path and write_path are not explicitly provided.
        auto_sanitize (bool): Flag indicating whether to automatically sanitize the settings after loading and saving. Defaults to False. If True, toggles both auto_sanitize_on_load and auto_sanitize_on_save.
        config_format (Optional[str]): The format of the settings file. Defaults to None. If None, the format is inferred from the file extension.
        default_settings (T): The default settings data. Must be provided.
        read_path (Optional[str]): The path to read the settings file from. Defaults to None.
        write_path (Optional[str]): The path to write the settings file to. Defaults to None.
        autosave_on_exit (bool): Flag indicating whether to automatically save the settings when the program exits. Defaults to False.
        auto_sanitize_on_load (bool): Flag indicating whether to automatically sanitize the settings after loading. Defaults to False.
        auto_sanitize_on_save (bool): Flag indicating whether to automatically sanitize the settings before saving. Defaults to False.

    Attributes:
        settings (T): The current settings data.

    Methods:
        save(): Save the settings data to a file.
        autosave(): A context manager that allows you to save the settings data to a file within a context block.
        load(): Load the settings from the specified file into the internal data attribute.
        sanitize_settings(): Sanitizes the settings data by comparing it to the default settings and removing any invalid or unnecessary values.
        restore_defaults(): Restores the settings data to the default settings.
